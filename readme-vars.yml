  ### Please note, Unifi change the location of this option every few releases so if it's not where it says, search for "Inform" or "Inform Host" in the settings.

  For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System > Advanced and set the Inform Host to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox "Override" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).

  In order to manually adopt a device take these steps:

  ```
  ssh ubnt@$AP-IP
  set-inform http://$address:8080/inform
  ```

  The default device password is `ubnt`. `$address` is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and `$AP-IP` is the Access Point IP address.

  When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting "DHCP Gateway IP", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address.

  ### Setting Up Your External Databases

  **Please Note: We will not provide support for migrating existing installs to an external database setup.**

  Formally only Mongo 3.6 and below are supported, however, it has been reported that versions up to 5.x will work. If you choose to use a newer version be aware that you will not be operating a supported configuration.

  Create your databases with:

  `mongo --eval 'db.getSiblingDB("MONGO_DBNAME").createUser({user: "MONGO_USER", pwd: "MONGO_PASS", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "MONGO_DBNAME"}]})'`

  `mongo --eval 'db.getSiblingDB("MONGO_DBNAME_stat").createUser({user: "MONGO_USER", pwd: "MONGO_PASS", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "MONGO_DBNAME_stat"}]})'`

  Being sure to replace the placeholders with the same values you supplied to the Unifi container. It is assumed if you are choosing to use this image tag then you have a good understanding of mongodb and how to manage external database configuration for Unifi Controller.
