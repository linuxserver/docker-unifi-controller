    ### Version Tags

    This image provides various versions that are available via tags. `latest` tag provides the latest stable build from Unifi, but if this is a permanent setup you might consider using the LTS tag.

    | Tag | Description |
    | :----: | --- |
    | latest | releases from the latest stable branch. |
    | LTS | releases from the 5.6.x "LTS Stable" branch. |
    | 5.9 | releases from the 5.9.x branch. |
    | 5.8 | releases from the 5.8.x branch. |
    | 5.7 | releases from the 5.7.x branch. |

    ## Common problems
    When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting "DHCP Gateway IP", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address.

  The webui is at https://ip:8443, setup with the first run wizard.

  For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform ip address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an ip address not accessable by other devices. To change this go to Settings > Controller > Controller Settings and set the Controller Hostname/IP to an ip address accessable by other devices.

  Alternatively to manually adopt a device take these steps:

  ```
  ssh ubnt@$AP-IP
  mca-cli
  set-inform http://$address:8080/inform
  ```

  Use `ubnt` as the password to login and `$address` is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and `$AP-IP` is the Access Point IP address.
