  The webui is at https://ip:8442, setup with the first run wizard.

  For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System Settings > Controller Configuration and set the Controller Hostname/IP to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox "Override inform host with controller hostname/IP" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).

  In order to manually adopt a device take these steps:

  ```
  ssh ubnt@$AP-IP
  set-inform http://$address:8081/inform
  ```

  The default device password is `ubnt`. `$address` is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and `$AP-IP` is the Access Point IP address.

  When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting "DHCP Gateway IP", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address.
