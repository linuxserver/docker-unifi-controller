  ### From 2024-01-01 this image will be deprecated and it will no longer be updated. Please migrate to our [Unifi Network Application](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-network-application) image instead

  See: [https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-09-06-unifi-controller](https://info.linuxserver.io/issues/2023-09-06-unifi-controller) for more information.

  The webui is at https://ip:8443, setup with the first run wizard.

  For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System > Advanced and set the Inform Host to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox "Override" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).

  **Please note, Unifi change the location of this option every few releases so if it's not where it says, search for "Inform" or "Inform Host" in the settings.**

  In order to manually adopt a device take these steps:

  ```
  ssh ubnt@$AP-IP
  set-inform http://$address:8080/inform
  ```

  The default device password is `ubnt`. `$address` is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and `$AP-IP` is the Access Point IP address.

  When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting "DHCP Gateway IP", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address.
